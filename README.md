# Flappy Bird with Reinforcement Learning
This project is to create a FlappyBird game and subsequently, build a neural network to play it.
The project can be divided into two parts:
1. Use Pygame (a Python library) to create the Flappy Bird game
2. Employ NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to train a neural net to play the game

NEAT is at https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html

# Usage #
1. To run the Notebook, please install both Pygame and NEAT-python:

pip3 install pygame

pip3 install neat-python

2. Open the "Flappy Bird.ipynb" and run the cells in order.
